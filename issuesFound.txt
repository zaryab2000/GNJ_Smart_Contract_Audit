# MAJORSSSS

* Total SUpply is Different Than Initial Supply sent to the owner at the time of deployment
* Mint Function doesn't increase the total Supply of the token

* Contract locking ether found in :
	Contract TreesFinance (treesFinance.sol#90-220) has payable functions:
	 - TreesFinance.constructor() (treesFinance.sol#103-106)
	But does not have a function to withdraw the ether
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#contracts-that-lock-ether

* CHeck CEIL FUnction - Multiplicatoin before division

* For loop over dynamic array

* CEIL from SafeMath is never used throughout the contract

* Zero Address Check Missing on multiTransfer() function - Line 144
* Zero Amount Value check on multiTransfer() function - Line 144

* Tokens NEVER bURN While Transfer Function

* Tax is applicable for Owner As well.

# Minorssss
* Hardcoded Address ISsue
* TreesFinance.basePercent (treesFinance.sol#100) should be constant
* Implicit Visibility needs to be checked once
* TOO MANY DIGITS ISSUE 
TreesFinance.constructor() (treesFinance.sol#103-106) uses literals with too many digits:
	- mint(msg.sender,3000000000000000000000) (treesFinance.sol#105)
TreesFinance.slitherConstructorVariables() (treesFinance.sol#90-220) uses literals with too many digits:
	- _totalSupply = 5000000000000000000000 (treesFinance.sol#99)
